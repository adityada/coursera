# Introduction to Mathematical Thinking Assignments and Problem Sets
# Assignment 1

______
###  Find two unambiguous (but natural sounding) sentences equivalent to the sentence the man saw the woman with a telescope, the first where the man has the telescope, the second where the woman has the telescope. 

The man saw the woman who was holding the telescope.
The man saw the woman through a telescope. 
______

### For each of the three ambiguous newspaper headlines I stated in the lecture, rewrite it in a way that avoids the amusing second meaning, while retaining the brevity of a typical headline:
### (a) Sisters reunited after ten years in checkout line at Safeway.
### (b) Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it.
### (c) Mayor says bus passengers should be belted.


Sisters meet for the first time in 10 years at a checkout line in Safeway.
City authorities are analysing the potential causes of a large hole appealing in High Street.
To ensure safety, passengers should wear seatbelts, says mayor.__
______

### The following notice was posted on the wall of a hospital emergency room:
### > No head injury is too trivial to ignore.
### Reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (The context for this sentence is so strong
### that many people have difficulty seeing there is an alternative meaning.)

Never ignore any case of head injuries!
______
### You often see the following notice posted in elevators:
### In case of fire, do not use elevator.
### This one always amuses me. Comment on the two meanings and reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (Again, given the context for this notice, the ambiguity is not problematic.)

There are two meanings to this setence.
In case there’s a fire, don’t use the elevator. This means that we should NEVER use the elevator, since there’s a chance that fire will occur. 
When a fire starts, do not use the elevator.
This sentence could be reformulated to:
In the case of fire, do not use the elevator. Use the stairs.
______

### Official documents often contain one or more pages that are empty apart from one sentence at the bottom:
### This page intentionally left blank.
### Does the sentence make a true statement? What is the purpose of making such a statement?
### What reformulation of the sentence would avoid any logical problems about truth? (Once again, the context means that in practice everyone understands the intended meaning and there is no problem. But the formulation of a similar sentence in mathematics at the start of the twentieth century destroyed one prominent mathematician’s seminal work and led to a major revolution in an entire branch of mathematics.)

Well, it isn’t a true statement, since the author wrote in the page. A reformulation would be: Intentionally, no information of any use is in this page.
______
### Find (and provide citations for) three examples of published sentences whose literal meaning is (clearly) not what the writer intended. [This is much easier than you might think. Ambiguity is very common.]

1. #### "World's most expensive cities for expats"
This sentence has two meanings. First of all is the intended meaning, which is the cities which are expensive for expats. The second, and the more literal meaning, is that the world's most expensive cities are exclusively for expats, which if you think about it, doesn't really make sense. (Citation: https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/most-expensive-cities-expats-2018/index.html)
2. #### "9 stabbed at Idaho apartment complex"
This sentence has two meanings. The first meaning is that nine people is stabbed in an apartment complex at Idaho. This is the intended meaning. The second meaning is that a person by the name of "9" was stabbed at an apartment complex in Idaho. A reformulation of this sentence would be "9 people stabbed at Idaho apartment complex." (Citation: http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/07/01/9-stabbed-at-idaho-apartment-complex-suspect-in-custody-police-say.html)
